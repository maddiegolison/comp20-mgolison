For this lab, you must also answer an important question: is it possible to request the data from a different origin (e.g., http://messagehub.herokuapp.com/) or from your local machine (from file:///) from using XMLHttpRequest? Why or why not? 
No, because of security reasons.  The is because of the same-origin policy.  This means that one web page may only access data in another web page if they have the same origin.  This is important because we do not want "malicious" websites to have access to activity on other sites.  One example would be a banking website (we would not want anyone but ourselves to have access to our information).
