		<h1>Assignment 4: Security Assessment</h1>
		<h3>Introduction </h3>
			<p>In our assignment 4, we learned how to implement a database that stores information from our assignment 2 (mmap).  However, we did not initially realize that our projects are laden with security vulnerabilities.  While analyzing Feiyu Lu's code, I learned that he had many vulnerabilities.</p>
			<p>During this assignment, I found myself wondering what is a vulnerability.  I was not sure at first what distinguishes a vulnerability from bad coding practices.  I learned that some issues were a mix of both, but for the most part vulnerabilities were problems with the code that would make it possible for someone else to alter the functionality of an application.</p>
		<h3>Methodology</h3>
			<p>I used a few different methods for finding vulnerabilities. One major one was utilizing curl to insert a script into Feiyu's database. Another method was then reading through his code to see if I could find any obvious flaws.</p>
		<h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
			<p>One of the only obvious ways I was able to break Feiyu's application was by curling bad data (e.g. scripts) to his database.  This code would be executed and would break his application's functionality.  Other findings I discovered were less obvious.  I discovered vulnerabilities that had to do with access to the information in his database.  The issue that I found was that anyone could access this information and they could alter it.</p>
		<h3>Issues Found</h3>
			<ol>
  				<h4><li>Cross Site Scripting</li></h4>
  					<ul>
   						<li>Location: when the GET method is called</li>
    					<li>Severity of Issue: HIGH because there would be no functionality if a user entered a malicious script using curl</li>
    					<li>Description of Issue: The issue with Feiyu's code is that I can curl data to his server without any barriers.  I was able to break his code by inserting a script that executed an alert when the page is loaded.</li>
    					<li>Proof of Vulnerability: <p><img src="ss1.png" alt="image1" height="300" width="600"> <img src="ss2.png" alt="image2" height="300" width="400"></p></li>
    					<li>Resolution: one could either parse the input or parse the output (when information is being retrieved from the database); however, it is much safer to parse the input when it is entered.  One way to do this is to substitute the script tags for the ampersand characters (with lt and gt).</li>
  					</ul>
   				<h4><li>Authentication</li> </h4>
  					<ul>
   						<li>Location: '/location.json'</li>
    					<li>Severity of Issue</li>
    					<li>Description of Issue:  Feiyu does not have any sort of authentication for his server.  Any person can have access to the data of a given person using /location.json?login=username.</li>
    					<li>Proof of Vulnerability</li>
    					<li>Resolution</li>
  					</ul>
   				<h4><li>Being able to change your lat and long to fake locations</li> </h4>
   					<ul>
    					<li>Location</li>
    					<li>Severity of Issue</li>
    					<li>Description of Issue</li>
    					<li>Proof of Vulnerability</li>
    					<li>Resolution</li>
  					</ul>
			</ol>
