<p>What is this purpose of this Git repository? 
	-The purpose of this repository was to store projects and labs that I created
	this semester.  It is helpful to have a copy on Git because I can refer to
	these projects anytime I have internet access.   Also, others can have access 
	to the code I have created and can modify it if necessary.</p>
<p>What was your favorite lab or assignment and why?
	-My favorite assignment was assignment 2.  It was interesting to see how easy
	it is to utilize the google maps api and how quickly I could create a 
	functional application.  It was also useful for learning how to implement
	functions from an api and knowing what to search when something goes wrong.</p>
<p>How much do you think you have grown from day 1 of this course to now?
	-I think I have grown a decent amount.  Before taking this course, the internet
	was one big "black box" for me.  I never understood how web apps were accessed
	or stored and I feel much more confident now that I understand so much more 
	about how the internet works.</p>
<p>What was the most important thing that you learned in this course? Cite two examples as evidence.
	-I think the most important thing I learned was the big idea of the course: that
	http is a request/response protocol.  
	1) In the beginning of the course we learned about how clients request data from
		servers and then the servers send a response.  I didn't fully comprehend this
		originally, but I understood that there are clients and servers, and that 
		webpages did not just appear out of nowhere!
	2) At the end of the course we created a database in assignment 3.  I finally 
		understood the relationship between the client and server, and how information
		is stored and received using request/response.</p>
<p>Now that you have finished the course, what topic would you like to delve deeper into?
	-I think it would be interesting to learn more about servers.  I'm curious about 
	how server-side storage works when there are multiple servers for one database.</p>
